If you have DungeonMaker installed as a shared library, then simply 
install as normal:

$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test
# make install

If, however, you wish to statically link the module, simply copy the files 
DungeonMaker.cpp and DungeonMaker.h to the top directory and instead do:

$ perl Makefile.PL.static
$ make
$ make test
# make install
